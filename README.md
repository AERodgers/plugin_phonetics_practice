# plugin_phonetics_practice v.0.2
An updatable plugin for [Praat](www.praat.org) to help students practise transcription and develop awareness of acoustic phonetics using Praat.

To use this plugin you need to download Praat onto your computer (www.praat.org).

Then:
1. Click on the **code** button above followed by **download ZIP**.
2. Download and unzip the folder and all its contents. (On a Windows PC, typically, you can right click and select _**extract all**_.)
3. Copy the **plugin_phonetics_practice** folder and *all* its contents into the **Praat preferences directory**.

    ([Click on this link](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/manual/preferences_directory.html) for guidelines on how to locate this directory on your computer. Note! Replace "miep" in the examples with your own user name on your computer!)

Once you have installed the plugin, you can access it from the **Praat** menu in the objects window. It will show up as **Anto's Phonetics Practice...**

NOTE: This is the first version of this plugin, which only includes two simple activities:

* A demonstration of how a complex waveform (sawtooth) can be understood as a combination of component (sinusoidal) parts
* A connected speech transcription / segmentation task.

V.0.2
* Added several new activities
* Added new procedures for feedback, instructions, and a few other things.

I will add more activities over time.

I will also add activity templates and features for educators to build their own activities. For now, however, I am mostly concerned with the user experience from the learner's perspective rather than the educator's.
