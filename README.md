# plugin_phonetics_practice v.0.1
An updatable plugin for [Praat](www.praat.org) to help students practise transcription and develop awareness of acoustic phonetics using Praat.

To use this plugin you need to download Praat onto your computer (www.praat.org).

Then:
1. Click on the **clone or download** button above followed by **download ZIP**.
2. Download and unzip the file.
3. Copy the **plugin_phonetics_practice** folder and *all* its contents into
 the **Praat preferences directory**.

    ([Click on this link](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/manual/preferences_directory.html) to find guidelines on how to locate this directory on your computer.)

Once you have installed the plugin, it can be access from the **Praat** menu in
the objects window. It will show up as **Anto's Phonetics Practice...**

NOTE: This is the first version of this plugin, which only includes two simple activities:

    * A demonstration of how a complex waveform (sawtooth) can be understood as a combination of component (sinusoidal) parts
    * A connected speech transcription / segmentation task.
. I will add more features for educators to build their own activities
