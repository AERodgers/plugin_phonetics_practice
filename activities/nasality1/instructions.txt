Nasal Voice Qualities
---------------------
You will be presented with a sequence of repetitions of the phrase, "Bobby and Nanna/Nanny".

  * Listen to each repetition, choose the option which best describes the voice quality.
  * When you are confident in your answer, click [Check].
    You will get feedback on your answers and some comments about the utterance.
  * Once you have made 15 guesses, you will be given a score!

Remember, this is not a test. The activity is designed to raise your awareness of the differences between modal, nasalised, hypernasal, hyponasal and denasal speech.

As always, let me know if you have any queries or corrections.
