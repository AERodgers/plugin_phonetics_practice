Connected Speech: The Grandfather passage
-----------------------------------------
You will see and hear an example of the  "The Grandfather Passage" broken into short chunks.

This will include a spectrogram and textgrid of each chunk.
  * The first tier of the textgrid shows the orthography.
  * The second tier shows the citation form of each word.
    Note that this would sound very unnatural as connected speech!
  * The third tier shows my transcription, which focuses on connected speech features and instances of /t/ lenition."
    I have not done an allophonic transcription of every sentence, but only included features relevant to the transcription task.
  * The final tier contains comments.

As always, let me know if you have any queries or corrections .
